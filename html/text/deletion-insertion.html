    ‘Welcome to Hogwarts,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘The start-of-term banquet
    will <ins>begin</ins> <del>commence</del> shortly, but before you take your
    seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is
    a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be
    something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the
    rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in
    your house common room.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‘The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and
    <ins>Slytherin</ins> <del>Thunderbird</del>. Each house has its own noble
    history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are
    at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any
    rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with
    the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour.

      >I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes
      yours.</ins

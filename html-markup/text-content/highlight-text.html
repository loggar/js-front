    ‘Welcome to Hogwarts,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘The start-of-term banquet
    will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you
    will be sorted into your houses. <mark>The Sorting</mark> is a very
    important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something
    like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of
    your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house
    common room.
  </p>

    ‘The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
    Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding
    witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts,
    <mark>your triumphs will earn your house points</mark>, while any
    rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with
    the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you
    will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.

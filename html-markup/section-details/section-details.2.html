    <summary>Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry </summary>
    <p>
      If you fancy living a Hogwarts-style life across the pond. The founder of
      Ilvermorny, Isolt Sayre, always wished she could go to Hogwarts, and the

    <summary>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry </summary>
    <p>
      Because you love it. But also because of its detailed history, secret
      passages, eccentric professors, wisecracking ghosts, lovely house-elves,
      talking portraits and much, much more besides. Most importantly, Hogwarts
      seems to have a sense of humour about itself, and round every corner is a
      new delight.

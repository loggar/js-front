Resolve domain name early with rel=dns-prefetch

You remember sites by their names, but servers remember them by IP addresses. This is why the domain name system (DNS) exists. The browser uses DNS to convert the site name to an IP address. This process—domain name resolution— is the first step in establishing a connection.

If a page needs to make connections to many third-party domains, preconnecting all of them is counterproductive. The preconnect hint is best used for only the most critical connections. For all the rest, use <link rel=dns-prefetch> to save time on the first step, the DNS lookup, which usually takes around 20–120 ms.

DNS resolution is initiated similarly to preconnect: by adding a <link> tag to the <head> of the document.

<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="http://example.com" />

<!--
Browser support for dns-prefetch is slightly different from preconnect support, so dns-prefetch can serve as a fallback for browsers that don't support preconnect.
-->

<!-- Do -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="http://example.com" />
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="http://example.com" />

<!-- Do not -->
<link rel="preconnect dns-prefetch" href="http://example.com" />

<!--
  Implementing dns-prefetch fallback in the same <link> tag causes a bug in Safari where preconnect gets cancelled.

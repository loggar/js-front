		Both requests and responses may contain body data. A body is an instance of any of the following types:

		ArrayBuffer
		ArrayBufferView (Uint8Array and friends)
		Blob/File
		string
		URLSearchParams
		FormData

		The Body mixin defines the following methods to extract a body (implemented by both Request and Response). These all return a promise that is eventually resolved with the actual content.

		arrayBuffer()
		blob()
		json()
		text()
		formData()

		This makes usage of non-textual data much easier than it was with XHR.

		Request bodies can be set by passing body parameters:
		*/
      var form = new FormData(document.getElementById('login-form'));
      fetch('/login', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: form
      });

      /*
		Both request and response (and by extension the fetch() function), will try to intelligently determine the content type.
		A request will also automatically set a Content-Type header if none is set in the dictionary.
		*/

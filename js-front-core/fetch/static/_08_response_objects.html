		As you have seen above, Response instances are returned when fetch() promises are resolved.

		The most common response properties you'll use are:

		Response.status — An integer (default value 200) containing the response status code.
		Response.statusText — A string (default value "OK"),which corresponds to the HTTP status code message.
		Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for checking that status is in the range 200-299 inclusive. This returns a Boolean.
		
		They can also be created programmatically via JavaScript, but this is only really useful in ServiceWorkers, when you are providing a custom response to a received request using a respondWith() method:
		*/
		var myBody = new Blob();

		addEventListener('fetch', function (event) { // ServiceWorker intercepting a fetch
			event.respondWith(
				new Response(myBody, {
					headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" }
				})
			);
		});

		/*
		The Response() constructor takes two optional arguments — a body for the response, and an init object (similar to the one that Request() accepts.)
